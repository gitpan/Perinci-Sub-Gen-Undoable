         [FIXES]

         - When calling record_call(), record original function arguments before
           being potentially modified by hook_check_args.

         - Grok if function is being called by txm during rollback (-tx_action
           is set to 'rollback'). Don't do our own rollback again under this
           condition.

0.01     2012-06-06

         First release. Setup::File::Symlink works using this module. Minimal
         tests. The transactional part has not been tested (waiting for
         Perinci::Tx::Manager).
