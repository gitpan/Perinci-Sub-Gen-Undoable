Revision history for Perinci-Sub-Gen-Undoable

0.10     2012-07-04 (SHARYANTO)

         Interpret 304 status (aside from 200) from step's check as success.


0.09     2012-07-04 (SHARYANTO)

         Sorry, another incompatible change. Hopefully no more in the near
         future.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - step's 'check' should return enveloped result.


0.08     2012-06-26 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - step's 'check' hook can also be an arrayref, for convenience.

         - Add step's 'check_or_fix'.


0.07     2012-06-23 (SHARYANTO)

         There are a couple of incompatible changes. API is still in flux. Sorry
         about this.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - 'hook_check_args' renamed to 'check_args' and no longer documented as
           temporary.

         - step's hooks 'gen_undo' and 'run' renamed to 'check' and 'fix',
           respectively.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - 'build_steps' can also be an array instead of code, for convenience.


0.06     2012-06-22 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - 'build_steps' is now passed \%args instead of %args, to make it
           consistent with others. Sorry about this.


0.05     2012-06-21 (SHARYANTO)

         [FIXES]

         - Remove old code in 'redo' part.


0.04     2012-06-21 (SHARYANTO)

         [FIXES]

         - Fix setting function result during rollback.


0.03     2012-06-21 (SHARYANTO)

         [FIXES]

         - When calling record_call(), record original function arguments before
           being potentially modified by hook_check_args.

         - Grok if function is being called by txm during rollback (-tx_action
           is set to 'rollback'). Don't do our own rollback again under this
           condition.


0.02     2012-06-07 (SHARYANTO)

         Fix a couple of typos.


0.01     2012-06-06 (SHARYANTO)

         First release. Setup::File::Symlink works using this module. Minimal
         tests. The transactional part has not been tested (waiting for
         Perinci::Tx::Manager).
